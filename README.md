Hello, my name is Mateusz and I have a master's degree in electronics and an industrial IT engineer. 
I am interested in Information technology and electronics. 
As a graduate of the Wrocław University of Science and Technology in these fields, I would like to work as a programmer and develop my skills. 
I am open to new experiences, I am not afraid of challenges that lie ahead of me, I am eager to try new things and make new collaborations.
